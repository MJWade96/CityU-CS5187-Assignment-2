ASSIGNMENT 2
CS5187 VISION AND IMAGE 

Given stereo image pairs (three stereo pairs are provided in   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pdDkFpa59m4A02pLkUqI1H2Zb_GerLkK?usp=sharing  ),  you are required to write a program with C++ or Python or Matlab to compute the the Disparity Maps of each left (view1) image.    
For each stereo pair, the two images (named view1.png and view5.png) are already rectified so that all image motion is purely horizontal. Ground-truth disparity maps of the left view (view1) are also provided for reference.                
The reconstructed results will be evaluated by Peak_Signal-to-Noise_Ratio (PSNR): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_signal-to-noise_ratio . You can use the source code implemented by Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/psnr.html) or Python ( https://cvnote.ddlee.cc/2019/09/12/psnr-ssim-python ) for PSNR calculation. The PSNR is calculated against the ground-truth disparity map. The higher PSNR you can achieve, the better performance you will get.                                             
   Hints:
   To complete the task, if you select OpenCV, the following OpenCV functions you can use:
o xfeatures2d.SIFT_create()		// SIFT
o BFMatcher()				// feature matching
o findFundamentalMat()			// fundamental matrix
o computeCorrespondEpilines()		// epipolar line
o stereoRectifyUncalibrated()		// image rectification
o warpPerspective()			// perspective warping
Deep learning based methods can also be adopted. For example, you can use external datasets for model pretraining.
